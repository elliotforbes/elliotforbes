### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Elliot and I've been in the software industry for about 10 years now in one form or another. 

In the past, I've done a lot of recording of programming videos and had a channel on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/tutorialedge) as well as on my site [TutorialEdge](https://tutorialedge.net). 

I'm currently in the process of joining GitLab as a Staff Software Engineer in their Developer Experience domain!

### Previous Companies:

* I used to work with the great folks at CircleCI leading up the Source of Change team. This involved leading the technical direction of the team and trying to expand the number of integrations that CircleCI worked with (for example the GitLab integration).
* I used to work on the PayTech team at Curve building out their next gen payment platform. 
* I used to work as a Senior Infrastructure Engineer building cool things at JPMorgan. This included being the lead automation engineer for the largest CloudFoundry platform in the world as well as other internal roles such as helping folks onboard their applications onto the cloud and giving talks.
